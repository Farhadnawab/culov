                            In 2012 we set out to create a team which builds relationships and advances families lifestyles through generations. Rather than focusing on satisfying needs with appropriate products, we started working on fixing problems in peoples’ finances, building plans that have specific life goals, and making managing assets and resources to those specific goals an experience. The financial well-being of the families we serve is at the center of everything we do. <br><br>

                            Our team joined Morgan Stanley in 2012, after fourteen years with bank-based wealth management practices.  While working with HSBC, we began forming a team and the process that, we thought, best serves the clients we felt we were the right fit for. A focus on private client services crystalized our ideas about the need for a true boutique family office for successful business owners and professionals, that is not reserved just for ultra-high net worth clients. Starting CWM as a firm was a result of our need to have the independence necessary for dedicating our time and focus to our process and growing with our clients.  <br><br> 

                            Wealth Management industry will grow and change with the new ways people communicate and live. Its products will be fully commoditized while good advice and guidance will always be valuable. We will adopt to the changes, embrace new technology that improves the experience, while continuing to always be HELPING FAMILIES EXCEL IN LIFE. <br><br> 
                            
                            <span class="custom-ul-title">Why a Peacock?</span><br><br> 

                            The peacock is a possessor of some of the most admired human characteristics, and is a symbol of integrity, guidance, protection, watchfulness, wisdom and the beauty we can achieve when we endeavor to show our true colors. It is the meaning of the peacock and what it portrays as to why we at Culov Wealth Management chose this as a symbol to represent who we are as a firm and as people. The idea of the peacock as a symbol first came to be when Emir was visiting Toronto University with his son. They were shown Toronto University, Robarts Library, whose building was built in the shape of a peacock to represent the meaning of the knowledge held inside it.

Wealth planning is a deeply personal decision that will affect your future and therefore it is a responsibility we do not take lightly. Culov Wealth Management commits to our clients to stay unconflicted in our work and to remain uncompromising in our values. Therefore, in order to execute comprehensive and well-established plans, there are several guidelines we recommend considering when evaluating if Culov Wealth Management is right for you:
                            </div>

                            <div class="opt">
                                <span>i. You are comfortable using one wealth management advisory practice for all your wealth planning.</span> In order to properly execute your personalized investment strategy and mitigate risk, it’s important we have the visibility and discretion to help you achieve your life goals by being your sole advisor. <br><br>

                                <span>ii. You are willing to entrust us to build a personalized goal-based wealth plan and use it as a guide to investment policy.</span> This includes giving us the discretion to act as your proxy to change allocations, adjust the plan as necessary, and work with your accountants and attorneys to execute against your overall financial strategy. <br><br>

                                <span>iii. Open communication is a prerequisite so as to provide a comprehensive plan.</span> It is difficult, if not impossible, for our practice to make comprehensive recommendations with only a partial picture of your financial standings. <br><br>

                                <span>iv. You have $500,000 or more of investable assets.</span>  These assets need not all reside with Culov Wealth Management (such as those in 401Ks, IRAs, and the like), however portfolios below this amount may be cost prohibitive for the level of wealth management advisement afforded by the practice.

                                If the above guidelines are consistent with your needs in selecting a wealth management advisory practice, we invite you to contact us to schedule an initial evaluation so that we can further ensure Culov Wealth Management is right for your individualized needs.
